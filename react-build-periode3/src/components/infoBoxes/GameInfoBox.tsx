        The Pokémon games, developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, have been the foundation of the Pokémon franchise since the release of the first games in 1996. The main series of Pokémon games are role-playing games (RPGs) that allow players to take on the role of a Pokémon Trainer. The goal of the game is to capture and train Pokémon to battle against other Trainers, earn gym badges, and become the Pokémon Champion.

        The core series of games are divided into generations, with each new generation introducing new Pokémon species, regions, mechanics, and gameplay features. The games typically follow a familiar formula: players explore different regions, capture wild Pokémon, battle against Gym Leaders, thwart the schemes of evil teams (like Team Rocket), and compete in Pokémon League tournaments.

        In addition to the main series, there have been numerous spin-off games that explore different genres and gameplay styles. These include puzzle games like Pokémon Puzzle League, battle-focused games like Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Rumble, and even games focused on caring for Pokémon, such as Pokémon Camp and Pokémon Go.

        Pokémon has been a massive commercial success, becoming one of the best-selling video game franchises in history. The games have evolved over time, with advancements in graphics, gameplay, and storylines, yet they continue to maintain the core elements that made them beloved by fans: exploration, collection, and strategy.
