      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters," was created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori and debuted as a video game for the original Game Boy in 1996. The franchise was inspired by Tajiri's childhood interest in collecting creatures and his love for nature. The original concept of Pokémon was born from the idea of kids capturing and collecting creatures to battle with each other.
