      <p className="text-gray-700">
        The art of Pokémon has played a significant role in shaping the identity and success of the franchise. The original Pokémon designs were created by Ken Sugimori, a talented Japanese illustrator. Sugimori and his team of artists were inspired by various animals, plants, mythology, and even everyday objects to bring each creature to life. The designs are colorful, imaginative, and convey a unique personality for each Pokémon, making them instantly recognizable to fans worldwide.
